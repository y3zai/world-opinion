## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser
- Gemini API key (get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### Option 1: Download CRX (Recommended)

1. Download `world-opinion.crx` from the [latest release](https://github.com/y3zai/world-opinion/releases/latest)
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)
4. Drag and drop the `.crx` file onto the page

### Option 2: Load Unpacked (For Developers)

1. Clone or download this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/y3zai/world-opinion.git
   cd world-opinion
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project directory

### Configure Your API Key

1. Click the World Opinion extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Click the ⚙️ Settings button
3. Enter your Gemini API key
4. Click "Save Settings"

## Usage

1. Navigate to any web page you want to analyze (news article, blog post, etc.)
2. Click the World Opinion extension icon
3. Click "🌍 See How World Says"
4. Wait for the analysis to complete
5. View related prediction markets and their current probabilities

## How It Works

1. **Content Extraction**: The extension extracts text content from the current web page
2. **AI Analysis**: The Gemini API analyzes the content and identifies key topics, entities, and events
3. **Market Search**: Using the extracted keywords, the extension searches Polymarket's API for related prediction markets
4. **Display Results**: Related markets are displayed with their current probabilities and other relevant information

## API Integration

### Gemini API

The extension uses Google's Gemini Pro model to analyze web content. The API:
- Processes page titles, descriptions, and main content
- Extracts relevant keywords and topics
- Identifies entities and events that might have prediction markets

### Polymarket API

The extension queries Polymarket's CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) API to:
- Search for active prediction markets
- Retrieve market probabilities
- Get market metadata (volume, descriptions, etc.)

## Privacy & Security

**World Opinion is designed with privacy as a core principle.** Unlike many extensions that route your data through their servers, World Opinion has **no backend servers**—all processing happens directly in your browser.

### Why This Matters

| Traditional Extensions | World Opinion |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Your data → Their servers → API | Your data → API directly |
| They can log, analyze, sell your data | No intermediary, no data exposure |
| Requires trusting the extension developer | Trust is verifiable (open source) |

### Our Privacy Guarantees

- **🚫 No Backend Servers**: Your data never touches our servers because we don't have any
- **🔐 Local Storage Only**: Your API key is stored locally in Chrome's storage, never transmitted except to Google's API
- **📡 Direct API Calls**: Page content goes directly from your browser to Google Gemini—no middleman
- **🙈 No Tracking**: No analytics, no usage statistics, no cookies, no user accounts
- **👆 User-Initiated Only**: Data is only processed when you click "See How World Says"—never in the background
- **📖 Open Source**: Review our code anytime to verify these claims

### 🏠 Maximum Privacy: Gemini Nano (On-Device AI)

For users who want **absolute privacy**, World Opinion supports **Gemini Nano**—Google's on-device AI model that runs entirely on your computer:

- **Zero Network Transmission**: Your page content never leaves your device
- **No API Key Required**: Works without any external service
- **Instant Processing**: No network latency, faster results
- **Available Automatically**: If your device supports Gemini Nano, it appears as an option in Settings

With Gemini Nano, the only network calls are to Polymarket to fetch market data—the AI analysis happens 100% locally.
